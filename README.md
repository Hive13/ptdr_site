ptdr.hive13.org
================

This is the rails application that drives ptdr.hive13.org, and all of the public-facing components of power tool drag racing.

While in it's infancy, this application's goal is to be the electronic nerve center and public-facing portal for all PTDR
activities, including

* Electronic signatures on waivers (Done: 8/29/2015 by IMW)
* Photo storage and delivery
* Brackets
* Racer Profiles
* Much, much more (that we have yet to really determine what that is yet.)

Ian Wilson and Ryan Hershey have access to the ptdr server, which is running on Ian's Digital Ocean account.
